		<p>With various iconic TV shows gracing our screens over the years, three shows that have stood out and continue to be cultural phenomenom to this day include: <strong>The Sopranos</strong>, <strong>Game of Thrones</strong>, and <strong>Breaking Bad</strong>. But how popular were these TV shows when they initially aired on U.S television?
		<br>By gathering data on the initial viewership across the various seasons and episodes, we can draw conclusions about how each show resonated with audiences in their time, identifying key turning points in their popularity.</p>
	
		<h3>The Sopranos</h3>
		<p><strong>The Sopranos</strong> had a notable trajectory in terms of viewership. While the series had strong viewership from its inception, it peaked in Season 4. Episode 1 of this season was particularly significant, boasting the highest number of viewers for any episode in the show’s run. Afterward, the show experienced a decline in viewership, with the final season (Season 6) showing a noticeable drop compared to earlier seasons. However, <strong>The Sopranos</strong> still maintained a strong average viewership across its lifespan, with the highest average viewership of the three shows analysed.</p>

		<h3><br>Game of Thrones</h3>
		<p><strong>Game of Thrones</strong> displayed a different trend, with a consistent increase in viewership across all seasons. The show gained a larger audience as it progressed, culminating in the final episode, which garnered the highest number of viewers. Unlike <strong>The Sopranos</strong>, which saw a peak followed by a decline, <strong>Game of Thrones</strong>’ popularity only grew, reaching its peak in its final season. This steady growth in viewership can be attributed to the show’s expanding fanbase over time.</p>

		<h3><br>Breaking Bad</h3>
		<p><strong>Breaking Bad</strong> had a more gradual increase in viewership over its five seasons, with a notable shift occurring after Episode 9 of the final season. Prior to this episode, the show’s viewership remained relatively stable. However, after Episode 9, viewership spiked significantly, with the final episode garnering a much larger audience compared to earlier episodes in the show’s run. This surge in viewers in the final episodes reflects the growing buzz and anticipation surrounding the show’s conclusion.</p>
