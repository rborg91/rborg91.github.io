		<h2>Bash script that git pulls a repository and cleans up local branches that no longer exist remotely.</h2>
		
		<p><br>At work, I found myself wanting to clean up the local branches
		for my repositories so that I wouldn't have a messy list of old branches
        when I ran <code>git branch -a</code>. It would end up with me 
       	repeatedly running a bunch of git commands all the time. 
        So I thought, shouldn't there be a better way
        where I can do all these same steps in one command. This resulted in the
        creation of a bash script with a symbolic link to PATH so that I can now
        clean up my repositories with one commmand.
